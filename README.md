## CellMojo

### What is CellMojo?
CellMojo is an open-source and free Python toolbox developed to address key image processing tasks in **cell migration** research.

The toolbox is composed of distinct modules that take care of:

- image pre-processing
- cell segmentation
- cell morphology quantification
- cell tracking

These key functionalities are depicted in a typical **CellMojo analysis pipeline** in **Figure 1**.
